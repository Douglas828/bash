# Douglas828's Bash Scripts

Simple repository for my bash scripts.

List downloaded scripts:

```bash
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/Douglas828/bash/ Douglas828-bash
cd Douglas828-bash
./list_scripts.sh
```

File naming system:

[scriptName]_v[Version]{B}-{Date}.sh

{} = Progress update on script. 
[] = Finished script naming convention.

Script Categories:
1. Testing (Scripts that have yet to be fully finished and debugged. Experimental versions. Use at your own risk!)
2. Fun (Random scripts made for, well, fun!)
3. onStart (Scripts made with the sole purpose of automating your PC startup!)
4. shutDown (Scripts that shutdown the computer. Useless, but it's an option.)

Future Bash Scripts:

- Revamped Start Script (onStart.sh)
- Help Script (help.sh)
- What Is This Coin Script (coinInfo.sh)
- Folder Organization
- Name Overhaul (Proper naming conventions)
