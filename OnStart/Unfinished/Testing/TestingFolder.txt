-=- The Testing Folder! -=-

This folder's only purpose is for me to commit my progress - incase a script is taking a while,
or I just want to show what's new. 

These scripts are *Experimental*, meaning that they CAN and WILL contain bugs and errors.
This will potentially render the testing script useless.

*Use at your own risk*
